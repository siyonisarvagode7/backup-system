# 🧠 Automated Backup System with Screenshot Capture

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Automated Backup System** is a Bash-based utility designed to simplify and automate the process of backing up important files and folders.  
It compresses data into `.tar.gz` archives, generates integrity checksums, maintains a smart backup rotation system (daily, weekly, and monthly), and logs every operation performed.  

In addition, this version integrates a **Python-based screenshot module**, which automatically captures a screenshot of the system when a backup completes.  
This helps in monitoring and validating the backup visually — ideal for audits, QA, and demonstrations.

## ⚙️ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧩 **Automatic Backups** | Takes a folder as input and creates compressed backups with timestamped names. |
| 🔒 **Lock File Mechanism** | Prevents multiple backup scripts from running simultaneously. |
| 🧮 **Checksum Verification** | Uses `sha256sum` to verify backup integrity and detect corruption. |
| 🧹 **Smart Rotation** | Keeps 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 3 monthly backups — older ones are deleted automatically. |
| ⚙️ **Configuration File** | Allows users to modify backup destination, retention count, and exclusion patterns easily. |
| 📜 **Logging** | Every step is recorded in a `backup.log` file with timestamps and statuses. |
| 🧪 **Dry Run Mode** | Simulates backup actions without making changes (for testing safely). |
| 🧾 **Restore Option** | Restore any existing backup to a custom location. |
| 🖼️ **Screenshot Capture** | Automatically captures and saves a screenshot when a backup completes. |
